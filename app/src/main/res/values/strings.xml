    <string name="ems_help_1">Thank you for using SMS Alert! This application is designed to intercept text messages that are important to you and alert you over their arrival. The idea came from a volunteer firefighter who wanted to ensure he was always aware messages with high priority.</string>
    <string name="ems_help_2">Please email comments, questions, and enhancement requests to webmaster@3dx2.com</string>
    <string name="ems_help_3">The way this is achieved is by creating rules that will match specific telephone numbers or subsets of telephone numbers. Most times emergency messages come from a central office that owns a group of sms from addresses.</string>
    <string name="ems_help_4">Each rule defines how a message is matched and definitions on how it should be brought to your attention.</string>
    <string name="ems_help_5">To create your first rule, click the \'Add Rule\' button on the main page and follow the on screen instructions. These are very important and following them properly should allow you to intercept messages you care about.</string>
    <string name="ems_help_6">Rules can be deleted by editing them and clicking the \'Delete\' button on the bottom of the screen.</string>
    <string name="ems_help_7">Rules can be globally disabled by unchecking the appropriate box on the main screen. Specific rule enabled settings are retained when you choose to turn the message interception back on.</string>
    <string name="ems_help_title">SMS Alert Help</string>
    <string name="about_message">You are running version %1$s of SMS Alert.  This is created by Joshua Ross.</string>
